# Is Netflix Meeting Teenagers' Expectations?  
Enhancing Recommendation Systems with Advanced Ethical Frameworks

---

## Project Description
This project evaluates Netflix’s recommendation system for teenage users (15–19 years old) with a focus on period dramas. It implements advanced machine learning models (TF-IDF, Word Embeddings, KNN, and Hybrid approaches) while integrating metadata and ethical considerations to improve content relevance, diversity, and personalization.

---

## Features
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Utilizes TF-IDF to analyze textual descriptions.
- **Semantic Analysis**: Leverages Word Embeddings to understand contextual meaning.
- **KNN for Metadata Matching**: Combines TF-IDF and metadata for similarity scoring.
- **Hybrid Model**: Merges content and metadata features for enhanced recommendations.
- **Ethical Framework**: Ensures fairness, relevance, and reduced bias in recommendations.
